## Why
Due to the corona spread, many companies are forced to apply mobile work and new work approaches.
I expect that there will be x key learnings after that time

* KL1: People will feel lonely at some points if the teams don't think on bringing more informal communication into play
* KL2: The continous buzz on notifications when complete company works remote will drain out the individuals 
* KL3: Under the assumption that knowledge workers are available the expected outcomes will surprise 
* KL4: 

## What
* Hypothesis: To increase mobile work gains, we have to apply more asynchronous work methods
* Observation: Introduction of MS Teams, constant buzz of attention on what is happening next (Company does not understand, that )

## How
* Be careful with notifications on Teams, Slack whatever
* Allow asynchronous work to take place
* Bridge Distance (Media Richness Theorem) by enriched communication channels (use video)
* Bring non-formal communication into the teams (virtual coffee break, offtopic chatrooms, icebreaker games)

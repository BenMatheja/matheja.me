[Stop Trying to Make Hard Work Easy by Nir Eyal](https://superorganizers.substack.com/p/stop-trying-to-make-hard-work-easy)

Nir Eyal hightlights the number one barrier to getting our work done is distraction. And for me quite interesting elaborates on the opposite of distraction which is not focus, it's traction.

From his perspective the main challenge to remain productive i.e gaining traction is mastering our triggers. They may be internal (our discomfort when pushed to focus on a given task without allowing distraction to ourselves) as well as external triggers (disturbances like a message on our phone).

# Why
* Storage on VPS is expensive (netcup storage - 1,5TB 15â‚¬ per month)
* Backblaze is cheap
* Have a self-controlled solution available

# What
* Owncloud (oc app, redis, mariadb) in a container
* nginx (and letsencrypt ) in a container
* Using Backblaze B2 as cheap object storage Backend (encrypted)

# How
* Owncloud seemingly does not offer a native Backblaze B2 Integration
* Use https://github.com/minio/minio/blob/master/docs/gateway/b2.md as a local Gateway to b2 storage
* Handle Encryption to not let backblaze spy on our data (in-transit encryption?)
* Could load-balance the Storage-Container
* OC -> minio1 -> Backblaze B2
* OC -> minio2 -> Backblaze B2

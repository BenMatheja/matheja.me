&lt;p&gt;Within a meeting with my former Manager Julian, I did a short glance on his screen spotting the infamous red icon. Knowing that Julian was really passionate towards efficient working approaches I had to do some research on the at-that-point unknown app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later the underlying concept, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/&quot;&gt;Getting Things Done methodology&lt;/a&gt;  tremendeously helped me to stay focussed during the completion of my Masters studies. If you haven‚Äôt already read the &lt;a href=&quot;https://gettingthingsdone.com/getting-things-done-the-art-of-stress-free-productivity/&quot;&gt;Book&lt;/a&gt; i do recommend it. Don‚Äôt read it by heart, but get inspired by the concepts discussed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôve compiled some ‚Äúhacks‚Äù on this page which I use to make Todoist productivity tool of choice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-shared-projects&quot;&gt;Use Shared Projects&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm using a shared project as a shopping list with my spouse. It‚Äôs dead simple and works with her free plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-not-ending-tasks-with-bold-typeface&quot;&gt;Use not Ending Tasks with bold typeface&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To get a better overview within Projects, you can define tasks which are not completeable serving as kind of sections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both convetions lead to a non completeable task with a bold typeface&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* **Gelbe S√§cke** üóë
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;* !!Work!! üëî
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;using-unicode-emojis&quot;&gt;Using Unicode Emojis&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Todoist supports &lt;a href=&quot;https://unicode.org/emoji/charts/full-emoji-list.html&quot;&gt;unicode Emojis&lt;/a&gt; within Tasks, Projects and Labels.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-webhook-integration-for-custom-workflows&quot;&gt;Use Webhook Integration for Custom Workflows&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I‚Äôm using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.todoist.com/sync/v7/#webhooks&quot;&gt;Todoist Webhooks&lt;/a&gt; to feed completed Tasks into AWS Lambda which inspects the completed task and triggers custom actions such as creating a new task.
The integration is pretty similar to that what &lt;a href=&quot;https://zapier.com&quot;&gt;Zapier&lt;/a&gt; within premium does, besides it costs me 0‚Ç¨ as it runs within the AWS free tier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Currently using that to remind me before reaching the 10-hours working time limit in Germany.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The function is based &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/BenMatheja/todoist-flask&quot;&gt;on a previous project&lt;/a&gt; which did the same as a standalone Python &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;use-inbox-for-ideas&quot;&gt;Use Inbox for ideas&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKjIJYCfBJA&amp;amp;feature=youtu.be&quot;&gt;Use your Inbox to store Ideas&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
